# ECE470_LAB

This repo provides code and manual for ECE470: Introduction to Robotics.

## 1. Lab schedule

1. Lab1: Pick and Place experiment through Teach Pendent to solve Hanoi problem
2. Lab2: Get started with ROS (Node, Topic, Message) by Turtlesim
3. Lab3: The Tower of Hanoi with ROS
4. Lab4: Forward Kinematics of UR3e
5. Lab5: Inverse Kinematics of UR3e
6. Lab6: Image Processing (filtering, edge detection, segmentation and classification)
7. Lab7: Camera Calibration

## 2. Important

Due to **limited** time of lab session, it is strongly **recommended** to get prepared for lab session.

1. read lab manual before session and know what to do 
2. It is **encouraged** to complete your code before lab. 

> Any questions are welcomed.

## 3. Ubuntu and ROS (Optional)

if some of you guys want to debug in your own laptop, it is recommended to install ubuntu and ROS. Here show you some basic procedures.

### 3.1 VMware Workstation

1. Download VMware Workstation [here](https://www.vmware.com/cn/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html). Other virtual machine software (like VirtualBox) is fine. Recommended version: 16 Pro or 15 Pro.
2. Install it and activate license by yourself.

### 3.2 Ubuntu 20.04 & ROS

1. Download ubuntu **Desktop** image (.iso) in official website [here](http://www.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) or [Tsinghua Mirror](https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu-releases/20.04.5/).
2. Open VMware and create a new virtual machine.
3. Follow the steps in [install.md](./reference/install.md) in `reference` folder.

## 4. TODO

- [ ] modify `lab6_manual` and `lab7_manual`
- [ ] integrate camera snapshot into ROS for convenience
- [ ] and more...
